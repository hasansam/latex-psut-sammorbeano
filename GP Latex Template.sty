\section[Platform Requirements]{Platform Requirements}

\subsection[Mobile Application and Website]{Mobile Application and Website} \vspace{.01\textheight} 
The mobile application will be developed using the React JavaScript library for Android and iOS. 
The application is rather simple and not at all taxing and will run without trouble on almost any mobile device with an active internet connection. \\
The website will be accessible and should run effectively on any desktop or laptop with an active internet connection.

\subsection[Specimen Tracking System]{Specimen Tracking System} \vspace{.01\textheight} 
The hardware used in this project is an Arduino based vehicle tracking system. Arduino is a single-board microcontroller that - in this case -  
uses a global position system (GPS), and a global system module (GSM) to achieve real-time tracking of any vehile or object that bears and makes use of
a SIM card even if it's offline. \\ The system will be assembled inside of the vehicle. Two applications, for the admininstrator and the employee will be
developed to track all the vehicles.

\section[Non-Functional Requirements]{Non-Functional Requirements}

\subsection{Mobile Application and Website} \vspace{.01\textheight} 

\begin{enumerate}

    \item \textbf{Usability} \vspace{.01\textheight} \\ 
         All system features shall be simple, transparent, and user-friendly to all archetypes of users. 
         A clean GUI and clear indicators and labels on all text-fields in the forms will allow users to fill them as conveniently as possible.

    \item \textbf{Performance} \vspace{.01\textheight}  \\
         The program will perform swiftly and smoothly to make sure the forms are submitted and processed in a timely manner 
         so appointments can be made while delivering results as soon as they’re ready.

    \item \textbf{Security} \vspace{.01\textheight} \\ 
         There will be multiple functionalities in place to provide a secure program that assures the users of their information's safety. 
         And they're as follows
         \begin{itemize}
             \item [-] No user can access any information unless they login. This will prevent users from gaining access to other users’ personal information.
             \item [-] All passwords will be hashed and stored in a protected database to prevent any leaks of information.
                     The un-reversable hashing will provide additional security in case of a security breach.
         \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Availability} \vspace{.01\textheight}  \\ 
         The program will be available for use to fill forms at all times. Exceptions may occur during system maintenance.
         Which shall be conducted during times of minimum traffic.

    \item \textbf{Portability} \vspace{.01\textheight}  \\
         The program will be available as an application downloadable for Android and iOS. The program will conjointly be available as a website in like manner.

         The system shall use an unambiguous and user-friendly map to track the couriers distinctly. 
         While sending automatic notifications to couriers in case of an emergency being reported.

    \item \textbf{Performance} \vspace{.01\textheight}  \\
         The system shall run in real-time to track the couriers with no delays as long as the GPS hardware device is functioning properly. 

    \item \textbf{Availability} \vspace{.01\textheight}  \\ 
         Unavailability might occur during system maintenance. 
         This should not cause significant hindrance to any operations since the maintenance shall be concluded during off-times for couriers.

    \item \textbf{Maintainability} \vspace{.01\textheight}  \\
         Any new couriers being added should not cause any complications to the system as a whole. And maintenance shall conclude during couriers’ off-time.
