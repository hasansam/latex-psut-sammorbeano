\chapter[Introdution]{Introdution}

\section[Overview]{Overview}

In this project, a live tracking system of the different couriers working for MedLabs in Amman will be developed.
These couriers’ main job is to deliver varying medical samples from MedLabs branches to the main branch for further testing. 
A portion of these workers are also lab technicians who will be taking samples from the patients from their homes, 
the system will track their routes as well. 
Secondly, an application and a website will be developed to allow users to fill request-forms for their samples to be taken from home.
by a capable lab technician. As the only way to achieve that currently is through a phone call to MedLabs call-center. \\
There's undeniable value when it comes to making improvements to the health-care system in any way. And a dynamic, modern nad powerful
health-care system is of utmost significance to help our community. 
As for us working to build this project, learning new software, hardware, and technologies is of absolute importance
and growing am entrepreneurial sense delving into a new field such as this will greatly benefit our careers moving forward.


\section[Problem Statement]{Problem Statement}

The current system at MedLabs is based on users making phone calls directly to the call center to make an arragenment for their samples to be taken at home.\
Which regularly leads to heavy load on the call-center subsequently leading to customer dissastifcation. This inefficient and often confusing - for the patients - system
will be renovated by the software to be developed in this project. Which will make the process far simpler, faster, and more convenient for the patients 
while lifting sizeable load off the call-center.
A live tracking system of the couriers will also greatly benefit MedLabs business as a whole, by helping to optimise their already rich testing, and boosting efficiency.

\section[Platform Requirements]{Platform Requirements}

\subsection[Mobile Application and Website]{Mobile Application and Website} \vspace{.01\textheight} 
The mobile application will be developed using the React JavaScript library for Android and iOS. 
The application is rather simple and not at all taxing and will run without trouble on almost any mobile device with an active internet connection. \\
The website will be accessible and should run effectively on any desktop or laptop with an active internet connection.

\subsection[Specimen Tracking System]{Specimen Tracking System} \vspace{.01\textheight} 
The hardware used in this project is an Arduino based vehicle tracking system. Arduino is a single-board microcontroller that - in this case -  
uses a global position system (GPS), and a global system module (GSM) to achieve real-time tracking of any vehile or object that bears and makes use of
a SIM card even if it's offline. \\ The system will be assembled inside of the vehicle. Two applications, for the admininstrator and the employee will be
developed to track all the vehicles.

\section[Other Requirements]{Other Requirements}

\subsection[Hardware Requirements]{Hardware Requirements}

An arduino based device will be used within the system. Integrating it with the web service developed. The device revolves around the usage of GPS, and GSM, a circuit is designed to track the location of the vehicles using these technologies. The tracking system sends geographical coordinates back to the web server, feeding the data into the cloud. By using this system, we are able to share real time information about transportation. This will also aid the means of transportation by providing shortest paths to a certain coordinate to the user. \\
GSM module is used in this scenario for sending the coordinates of the vehicle to the server. GPS handles the continuous results of coordinates as a form of string data, known as longitude and latitude. Integrating it with the graphical user interface application, gives us the capability to showcase the location of a vehicle on a map dashboard in real-time.


\subsection[Software Requirements]{Software Requirements}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Recognition Model Requirements} \vspace{.01\textheight} \\ 
	With the addition of an Arduino based tracking device, tracking would be effortless. An API would be handling all the traffic between the server, and the application, hosting all the data on 	the cloud for ease of access and efficiency.\\
