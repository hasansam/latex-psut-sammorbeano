\section*{\LARGE {Abstract}}

The efficient use of new and upcoming technologies is significant when developing software. 
And for which, a real-time tracking system will be used in this project to maximise productivity 
in a courier-based system currently operated by MedLabs to process all the different medical 
samples. Moreover, two applications will be developed, both of which are for MedLabs as well. 
The first application will be used by patients and will provide all the necessary services 
typically present in similar applications. The patients will also be able to fill a form 
requesting a medical sample to be taken from them from their homes. This is currently 
done through the call-center at MedLabs. Which introduces difficulties for the patients as well 
as MedLabs themselves. The second application will be used by the couriers and the admins 
working for MedLabs, with each of them being able to make use of functionalities relevant 
to their roles. A real-time tracking system that uses GPS technology developed by fellow 
students from PSUT's King Abdullah II School of Engineering will be used by the admins 
to assign tasks to the couriers as effectively and efficiently as possible.

\chapter[Introdution]{Introdution}

\section[Overview]{Overview}

The real-time tracking system of the different couriers working for MedLabs in Amman will 
function as follows – these couriers’ main job is to deliver the different medical samples 
from MedLabs' branches to the main branch for further testing. A portion of these workers 
is also lab technicians who will be taking samples from the patients from their homes. 
The system will track all of their routes and display them on the admin's dashboard. 
This will allow the admins to allocate tasks to couriers as efficiently as possible. 
All of which will be achieved through the workers' application that will serve admins and 
couriers alike. MedLabs' patients will be able to fill request-forms for samples to be taken 
from home by a capable lab technician using the separate application developed for the patients. \\
There's an undeniable value when it comes to making improvements to the health-care system in 
Jordan or anywhere else. And a system that is dynamic, modern, and powerful is of 
unquestionable significance if we'd like our communities to grow strong. As for us working 
to build this project, learning new software, hardware, and technologies is both exhilarating 
and meaningful. And growing an entrepreneurial sense by delving into a new field such as 
this will greatly benefit our careers moving forward.

\section[Problem Statement]{Problem Statement}

The current system that's in place to serve patients from their homes is inefficient and costly. 
As it is based on the patients making phone calls directly to the call center to make an 
arrangement for their samples to be taken at home. Which introduces a need for more employees 
on the line, a bigger and more capable call-center, and perhaps even customer dissatisfaction 
in case the service was lousy or unavailable. This unfit and often confusing system will be 
renovated by the software to be developed in this project. Applications that will make the 
process far simpler, faster, and convenient for the patients. While lifting sizeable load 
off the call-center. Moreover, a real-time tracking system of the couriers will also greatly 
benefit the MedLabs business as a whole, by boosting the effectiveness of delivering the 
samples from and to the different branches.

\section[Related Work]{Related Work}

The Ground Positioning System (GPS) is owned and operated by the United States of America. 
It's a powerful system of more than 30 satellites orbiting the earth and constantly keeping 
a steady flow of signals being sent to ground stations scattered across the planet. 
This allows for the satellites' position to be known at all times. Using signals from at least 
4 of those satellites, a receiver can deduce its accurate position on the ground. 
This type of advanced and free to use technology should be used to better and improve existing 
and upcoming projects. This will be achieved in this project as we'll be incorporating a 
project our fellow students from PSUT's King Abdullah II School of Engineering have been 
working on. The project consists of a real-time tracking system that uses GPS to provide the 
most reliable positioning possible, regardless of whether the user has an active internet 
connection or not. This system will be built into each of the couriers' vehicles. 
And as long as a straight unobstructed line of sight is maintained between the vehicle and 
at least 4 satellites, the tracking will not be interrupted.

\section[Project Management Tools]{Project Management Tools}

\subsection{Storage}
A GitHub repository with separate branches was used to keep work synchronised and backed up. A master branch keeps the most important files from being edited improperly
while working on separate development branches and merging them to the master branch after careful auditing makes sure everything stays secure and up to date. 
A Google Drive folder was also used as back-up storage in case of any fatal emergency. This folder was updated as frequently as possible to ensure further safety.

\subsection{Planning}
A shared Google Keep note was used to keep track of all the different sections of the project that had to be completed. The simple interface of Keep helps keep everything
clear and easy to reach. A Google Tasks list was used to keep track of individual tasks assigned to each member of the team. Calls with screen-sharing enabled on Discord were made in case a team-member
needed aid in their tasks.

\subsection{The Document, Charts, and Diagrams}

\begin{itemize}
  \item [-] TexLive was used to compile the document into PDF format while Visual Code was used with the applicable extensions to write the Latex code itself.
  \item [-] TeamGantt was used to create the Gantt Chart.
  \item [-] Creately was used to illustrate the different use-case diagrams.
  \item [-] Lucidchart was used to build the activity diagrams and the entity-relationship (ER) diagram.
  \item [-] AdobeXD was used to create the prototype for the user interface.

\subsection[Mobile Applications and Website]{Mobile Applications and Website} 
The mobile application will be developed using the React JavaScript library for Android and iOS. 
The application is rather simple and not at all taxing and will run without trouble on almost any mobile device with an active internet connection.
The website will be accessible and should also run effectively on any desktop or laptop with an active internet connection.

\subsection[The Tracking System]{The Tracking System} 
The hardware used in this project is an Arduino-based vehicle tracking system. Arduino is a single-board microcontroller that - in this case -  
uses a Global Positioning System (GPS), and a Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) to achieve real-time tracking of any vehicle or object that bears and makes use of
a SIM card even if it's offline. The system will be assembled inside of the vehicle.

\section[Other Requirements]{Other Requirements}

\subsection[Hardware Specification]{Hardware Specification}

An Arduino based device will be used within the system. Integrating it with the web service developed. 
The device revolves around the usage of GPS and GSM. A circuit is designed to track the location of the vehicles using these technologies. The tracking system sends geographical coordinates back to the web server, 
feeding the data into the cloud. By using this system, we can share real-time information about transportation. This will also aid the means of transportation by providing the shortest paths to a certain 
coordinate to the user.\\ GSM is used in this scenario for sending the coordinates of the vehicle to the server. The GPS handles the continuous results of coordinates as a form of string data, 
known as longitude and latitude. Integrating it with the graphical user interface application gives us the capability to showcase the location of a vehicle on a map on a dashboard in real-time.

\chapter[System Design]{System Design}

This chapter illustrates the system's design using a plethora of diagrams and descriptions. The system's logical and architectural design are followed by the system's physical design, including the database
and a prototype of the user interface. 

\section[Logical Model Design]{Logical Model Design}

\subsection[Architectural Model Design]{Architectural Model Design}

The system is constructed using a Model View Controller (MVC) architecture. The GPS tracking device hands a combination of an altitude and latitude to the database. Which in turn's connected to the controller.
A REST API will be connected straight to the controller.
