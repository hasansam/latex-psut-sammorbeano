\section*{\LARGE {Abstract}} \vspace{.05\textheight}

The efficient use of new and upcoming technologies is significant when developing software. In this project we'll be making use of a real-time tracking system to maximise
productivity in a courier-based system currently operated by MedLabs to process all the different medical samples. Overall, two applications will be developed, both of which
for MedLabs. The first application will be used by patients and will provide all the necessary services typically present in similar applications. The patients will also be
able to fill a form requesting a medical sample to be taken from them from their homes. This is currently done through the call-center at MedLabs. The second application will
be used by the couriers and the admins with each being able to make use of functionalities relevant to their roles. A real-time tracking system that uses GPS technology developed
by fellow students at PSUT's King Abdullah II School of Engineering will be used by the admins to assign tasks to the couriers as effectively and efficiently as possible.

\chapter[Introdution]{Introdution}

\section[Overview]{Overview}

In this project, a live tracking system of the different couriers working for MedLabs in Amman will be developed.
These couriers’ main job is to deliver varying medical samples from MedLabs branches to the main branch for further testing. 
A portion of these workers are also lab technicians who will be taking samples from the patients from their homes, 
the system will track their routes as well. 
Secondly, an application and a website will be developed to allow users to fill request-forms for their samples to be taken from home.
by a capable lab technician. As the only way to achieve that currently is through a phone call to MedLabs call-center. \\
There's undeniable value when it comes to making improvements to the health-care system in any way. And a dynamic, modern nad powerful
health-care system is of utmost significance to help our community. 
As for us working to build this project, learning new software, hardware, and technologies is of absolute importance
and growing am entrepreneurial sense delving into a new field such as this will greatly benefit our careers moving forward.

\section[Problem Statement]{Problem Statement}

The current system at MedLabs is based on users making phone calls directly to the call center to make an arragenment for their samples to be taken at home.\
Which regularly leads to heavy load on the call-center subsequently leading to customer dissastifcation. This inefficient and often confusing - for the patients - system
will be renovated by the software to be developed in this project. Which will make the process far simpler, faster, and more convenient for the patients 
while lifting sizeable load off the call-center.
A live tracking system of the couriers will also greatly benefit MedLabs business as a whole, by helping to optimise their already rich testing, and boosting efficiency.

\section[Related Work]{Related Work}

The Ground Positioning System (GPS) is owned and operated by the United States of America. It's a powerful system of more than 30 satellites orbiting the earth 
and constantly keeping a steady flow of signals being sent. This allows for their position to be known at all times. Using signals from at least 4 of those satellites, 
a receiver can deduce its accurate position on the ground. \\ We'll be incorporating the project our fellow students from PSUT's King Abdullah II School of Engineering have been working on. 
The project consists of a real-time tracking system that uses GPS to provide the most reliable positioning possible, regardless of whether the user has an active internet connection or not. 
This system will be built into each of the couriers' vehicles. As long as a straight unobstructed line of sight is maintained between the vehicle and at least 4 satellites, the tracking will not be interrupted.

\section[Project Management Tools]{Project Management Tools}

\subsection*{Storage}
A GitHub repository with separate branches was used to keep work synchronised and backed up. A master branch keeps the most important files from being edited improperly
while working on separate development branches and merging them to the master branch after careful auditting makes sure everything stays secure and up to date. 
A Google Drive folder was also used as a back-up storage in case of any emergency. This folder was updated as frequently as possible to ensure further safety.

\subsection*{Planning}
A shared Google Keep note was used to keep track of all the different sections of the project that had to be completed. The simple interface of Keep helps keep everything
clear and easy to reach. A Google Tasks list was used to keep track of individual tasks assigned to each member of the team. 

\subsection*{Charts and Diagrams}
TeamGantt was used to create the Gantt Chart illustrated in figure 2.1.

The website will be accessible and should run effectively on any desktop or laptop with an active internet connection.

\subsection[Specimen Tracking System]{Specimen Tracking System} \vspace{.01\textheight} 
The hardware used in this project is an Arduino based vehicle tracking system. Arduino is a single-board microcontroller that - in this case -  
uses a global position system (GPS), and a global system module (GSM) to achieve real-time tracking of any vehile or object that bears and makes use of
a SIM card even if it's offline. \\ The system will be assembled inside of the vehicle. Two applications, for the admininstrator and the employee will be
developed to track all the vehicles.

\section[Other Requirements]{Other Requirements}

\subsection[Hardware Specification]{Hardware Specification} \vspace{.01\textheight}

An arduino based device will be used within the system. Integrating it with the web service developed. 
The device revolves around the usage of GPS, and GSM, a circuit is designed to track the location of the vehicles using these technologies.
The tracking system sends geographical coordinates back to the web server, feeding the data into the cloud. 
By using this system, we are able to share real time information about transportation. 
This will also aid the means of transportation by providing shortest paths to a certain coordinate to the user. \\
GSM module is used in this scenario for sending the coordinates of the vehicle to the server. 
GPS handles the continuous results of coordinates as a form of string data, known as longitude and latitude. 
Integrating it with the graphical user interface application, 
gives us the capability to showcase the location of a vehicle on a map dashboard in real-time.
